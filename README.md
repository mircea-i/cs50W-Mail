# cs50W-Mail

This is my take on **cs50w - Mail(project 3)** [requirements here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/)

It requires the implementation of a single- page application that has the functionality of an email client using Django (this part is already in place) and JavaScript (this is the part that needs doing). You have the API for everything provided, it only needs to be accessed. The aplication has multiple design requirements:


 - the login/logout functionality is already provided to you
 - the ability to send emails
 - easy access to inbox / sent / archive
 - each email can be viewed / replied / archived


## Final words
There are tricky parts like the non-submitting form in wich you compose the email and making sure that you get to the right view after taking action.
